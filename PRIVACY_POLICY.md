TrueBuy ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Chrome Extension.

### 1. Information Collection
TrueBuy is designed with a "privacy-first" approach. 
* **No Personal Data:** In version 1.0, we do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or phone numbers.
* **No Account Required:** You can use all features of TrueBuy without creating an account or providing any login credentials.

### 2. Data Usage and Processing
* **Local Processing:** All analysis of Amazon product data (ratings, review counts, etc.) is performed locally within your browser. 
* **Public Data Only:** TrueBuy only accesses public data available on Amazon product and search result pages to provide integrity scores and recommendations.
* **No Data Selling:** We never sell, rent, or share any user data with third parties.

### 3. Permissions Justification
TrueBuy requests the following permissions to function:
* **Storage:** To save your local preferences and settings.
* **Tabs:** To detect when you are on an Amazon page so the assistant can activate.
* **Host Permissions (*.amazon.com, *.amazon.co.uk):** To read product metadata and inject the analysis UI directly into the shopping site.

### 4. Affiliate Disclosure
TrueBuy participates in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program. When you click on recommended product links provided by the extension, we may receive a small commission. This helps us keep the tool free for users and does not result in any additional cost to you.

### 5. Third-Party Websites
Our extension interacts with Amazon.com and its international versions. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of Amazon or any other third-party websites you visit through our links.
